Go to sprites and copy + paste the textures into the "Baba Is You> Data> Sprites" folder.
Select yes and override.
Then play the levelpack. The pack will not look correct if you do not do this. (and might not even load!
who tf knows, i haven't tried this myself)

NOTE: Pack will not work if still in double folder. For some reason, github uses a double-zipped folder.
Please take "Baba_is_Whomst" out of "Baba_is_Whomst".
(UNZIP PACK FIRST!)


After that, plese enjoy!
